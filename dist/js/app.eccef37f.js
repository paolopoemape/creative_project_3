I was in the need of a haircut before a date tonight, I am actually exceptionally picky about who cuts my hair, and the guy I had been regularly seeing was too hard to get into at a time that worked for me, so in my search for a luxury barbershop I came across Tom Nox and booked a VIP service with Maka, and I was not disappointed in the slightest, she took her time on my hair and eyebrows making sure I looked my best, I can tell she really cares about how I looked and she did everything she could to have me looking at my best when I walked out of the shop, will definitely be back, and I would definitely recommend anyone who wants a legitimate haircut from a professional who takes their time and cares and is not just trying to get you out of their chair, I was also impressed by the cut that the other barber Ben was giving, while he didn’t cut my hair, I would definitely let him, this barbershop seems to have taken great pains to only staff the best people, and they are people who care about giving you the best service around. 5 stars 10/10 A+",review_3:"I came to Tom Nox to get my eye brows shaped and a hair cut.
